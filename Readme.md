# Application to run a scrape of Amazon Website Price Drops

The idea of the application is to take a product from the users watch list
in the 'priceCheck.js' file and the users desired price point and return an email to the user 
if the prouct on Amazon drops below that price point. The email will include the link to product 
to purchase if required.

##### Working On:

Function to loop through the 'pricesToBeChecked' array is only returnig this first index nothing after.
    **FIX REQUIRED**


### Further ideas:

- Setup the aplication to run daily/weekly. 
- Have one email with all prices on not individual ones. If prices match email a none match your price points email.
